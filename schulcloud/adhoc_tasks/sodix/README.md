# Sodix scripts

The scripts in this directory can be used to
- Download a list of all publishers from the sodix database
- Apply permissions from blacklist.json into edusharing

Both scripts only work with proper environment files
- .env.* (where * is the environment passed to the script, e.g. "dev" or "prod")

It is also necessary to set up a python virtual environment, as mentioned in the main readme.
